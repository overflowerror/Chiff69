Chiff69
=======

Chiff69 is a collection of encryption-algorithms, which use a keylength of 69 bit.   
   
Because this it made by an amateur __DO NOT__ use this software for any security applications.

   
Chiff69/a
---------

This algorithm uses 72 bit to encrypt the text, but the last 3 Bits will be set to 0. This one only uses substitutions.

Chiff69/b
---------

This one uses 64 bit for the substitution (like Chiff69/a). The last 5 bits are used for a rail-fence-cpher-style pre-permutation.
